WINDED simplifies responsive design by `iframe`-ing a single page across multiple breakpoints.

_ChatGPT on why this is useful:_

> This functionality is highly useful as it enables developers to simultaneously view and assess how their webpage appears on different screen sizes, thus saving time and improving accuracy in creating adaptable, user-friendly designs.

Though specifically created for Tailwind CSS, the preset breakpoints are valuable for almost any responsive application.
